## README Update Rules

**Objective:** Keep `README.md` concise and focused on users/developers needing to *run* or *understand* the project at a high level. Avoid deep technical details or exhaustive feature lists unless critical for getting started.

**Update Triggers & Content:**

1.  **Initial Setup:** Update "Getting Started" when the basic setup/build/run commands are established.
2.  **Core Functionality:** Update the main description and "Usage" section when significant user-facing features are completed and stable.
3.  **Dependencies:** Update "Getting Started" if new system dependencies or crucial setup steps are added.
4.  **API Changes (if applicable):** If the project exposes an API, update relevant sections when breaking changes or significant additions occur.
5.  **Versioning/Releases:** If we implement versioning, update `README.md` to reflect the latest stable version and link to a `CHANGELOG.md` (if we create one).

**Information Sources:** I should primarily use the "Project Vision", "Current State", and completed items from the "Roadmap" section of *this file* to inform `README.md` updates. Key technical details needed for setup should come from established configurations or installation scripts.
